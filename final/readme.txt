This game is very popular since I was little. I often play it with my brother. It is still a very fun game that I often play when I feel bored. Luckily, my brother is majoring at Computer Science, and he actually helps me a lot in this project.

Just click any alphabets in the keyboard, and if it's right then it will show up in the _ _ _ _ _, if not then the hangman drawings will show up stroke by stroke. If you fail too many times then you will lose. If you have choose the wrong alphabets for 4 times, a hint '?'button will appear. If you click the '?' button, hint about the word you have to guess will show up. If you choose the wrong alphabets for 10 times, then you lose; else, you win the game and you can try again if you want.
I hope this game brings you joy as much as it brings me!! Happy summer holiday! :D
