    <p>My name is Veronica. I am currently on my junior year majoring in Economics. I came from Indonesia. I was born and raised in a Chinese family. My great grandfather and my great grandmother came from Fujian. My grandfather is a Hokkienese and my grandmother
        is a Hakkanese. Therefore, I could speak both Hokkien and Hakka languanges. I feel so blessed to have a very loving family, I have one brother and two sisters who play, fight, and grow up with me.

        I have studied Chinese since I was little and my private tutor who taught me Chinese is a Taiwanese. Well clearly, I never thought of going to Taiwan for my studies, but I guess life always surprises you. At first, I was not used to Taiwan's weather,
        one minute it is raining, and the next minute it stops; especially on summer. My favorite food in Taiwan is 麻辣火鍋 and my least favorite food in Taiwan is 臭豆腐. Oh my God, it stinks! :(
